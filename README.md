### About Me:
I am an interdisciplinary computational research scientist investigating topics in microbial ecology, systems biology, and natural product discovery. My expertise in multi-omics (primarily (meta)genomics), pipeline development, and machine learning/artificial intelligence has been validated by an extensive track record of >30 peer-reviewed publications (10 of which I am lead author) with over 2000 citations. My career objective is to use cutting-edge computational approaches to translate microbiome research into biotechnology and, thus, increase value on sustaining natural environmental systems. 

I consider myself an environmentalist and while many of my projects investigate human health and disease, the methods I develop are intended to be broadly applicable to other research questions.  In particular, I am interested in identifying microbes that can be used in biotechnology (e.g., plastic degrading enzymes, drug discovery), biodiversity, how interactions between microbes change in relation to a warming climate, ecological preservation, and [planetary intelligence](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/intelligence-as-a-planetary-scale-process/5077C784D7FAC55F96072F7A7772C5E5).

### Affiliations:
* *NewAtlantis Labs* - Principal Bioinformatics Scientist

### Education:
* Ph.D in Biotechnology, *Durban University of Technology* (2022)
* M.Sc in Bioinformatics, *University of California Santa Cruz* (2016)
* B.Sc in Cellular and Molecular Biology, *San Diego State University* (2013)

### Research Highlights:
* Developed the [*VEBA*](https://github.com/jolespin/veba) modular end-to-end suite for in silico recovery, clustering, and analysis of prokaryotic, microeukaryotic, and viral genomes from metagenomes
  * [doi:10.1093/nar/gkae528](doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae528)
	* [doi:10.1186/s12859-022-04973-8](doi.org/10.1186/s12859-022-04973-8)

* Developed an explainable artificial intelligence methodology including novel feature selection algorithm (*Clairvoyance*), a Hierarchical Ensemble of Classifiers framework (HEC models), and a data analysis Python package (*Soothsayer*). These methods were developed to address challenges in antibiotic discovery pipeline but were designed with broad applicability. Collaboratively identified and characterized Darobactin (an antibiotic with novel activity isolated from the gut microbiome of nematodes) using said methodologies. 
	* [doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008857](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008857)
	* [doi:10.1038/s41586-019-1791-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1791-1)

* Developed a compositional feature engineering approach and an ensemble network analysis methodology that was extended for differential networks and sample-specific perturbation networks. These methods were developed to investigate dental caries and acute malnutrition but were also designed with broad applicability.
	* [doi:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac239](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac239)
	* [doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103644](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103644)
* Demonstrated how feature selection algorithm can be leveraged for identifying inferred interactions that are predictive of phenotypes.
 	* [doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103644](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103644) 
* Collaboratively identified beneficial microbes that are help corals withstand rising ocean temperatures.
